              tenancy. Subsequent events or facts cannot be considered and the
              Prescribed Authority is bound to order eviction according to the

              Under the old Act of 1947, permission could be granted in relation
              to the building under tenancy. The District Magistrate had no
              power to grant permission only in respect of any specified part
              thereof, Clause (rr) of Section 43 operates notwithstanding the
              repeal of the old Act of 1947. It provides for satisfaction of the
              order of permission granted under Section 3 of the old Act by the
              speedier method of eviction under Section 21 of the present Act.
              Under the old Act of 1947, the landlord after obtaining permission
              under Section 3 of that Act had to file a suit for eviction of the
              tenant. The suit naturally extended to eviction from the building
              under tenancy. It could not be for eviction from any specified
              part of the building under tenancy. Clause (rr) of Section 43
              provides a speedier remedy for the same relief. To achieve the
              same relief, it specifically says that the prescribed authority
              shall order the eviction of the tenant from the building under
              tenancy'.<span class="para-ref"

          question either, namely to satisfy itself all over again as to the
          grounds. The last part of clause (rr) says :-

          satisfy itself afresh that the grounds specified under Sub-Section (1)
          or Sub-Section (2) of Section 21 do exist. In this respect, the order
          granting permission under Section 3 of the old Act is final and
          conclusive. Its jurisdiction is only to see that the grounds on which
          the permission was obtained answer the description of the grounds
          specified under Sub-Section (1) or Sub-Section (2). If it is so
          satisfied, then it has no option but to order eviction of the tenant

          <b>15. </b>We have to keep in mind that 4 clause (rr) of Section 43
          operates not withstanding the repeal of the old Act of 1947. It
          provides for satisfaction of the order of permission granted under
          Section 3 of the old Act by the speedier method of eviction under
          Section 21 of the present Act. Under the old Act of 1947, the landlord
          after obtaining permission under Section 3 of that Act had to file a
          suit for eviction of the tenant. Clause (rr) of Section 43(2) provides
          a speedier remedy, no matter whether a suit had been instituted.

          <b>16. </b>Under the old Act of 1947, permission could be granted in
          relation to the building under tenancy. The District Magistrate had no
          power to grant permission only in respect of any specified part
          thereof. Under that Act, a suit had to be filed for the eviction of
          the tenant on the basis of the permission. The suit naturally extended
          to eviction from the building under tenancy. It could not be for
          eviction from any specified part of the building under tenancy. Clause
          (rr) of Section 43 provides a speedier remedy for the same relief. To
          achieve the same relief, it specifically says that 'the prescribed
          authority shall order the eviction of the tenant from the building
          under tenancy'.

          <b>17. </b>For the tenant it was submitted that under clause (rr), the
          Prescribed Authority can take into account subsequent events in order
          to satisfy itself that the ground or which the permission was obtained
          under the old Act will be satisfied by ordering eviction from any
          specified portion of the building.

          <b>18. </b>Clause (rr) operates as a substitute for a suit for
          eviction based on the permission granted under the old Act. Acceptance
          of the submission on behalf of the tenant would result in non-use of
          clause (rr) in many cases. Under cl.(rr), as construed on behalf of
          the tenant, the Prescribed Authority will have jurisdiction to order
          eviction from any specified part of the building. No landlord is going
          to take the risk of applying under Section 21 read with clause (rr) of
          Section 43(2) for the eviction of a tenant, because then he would run
          the risk of his attempt being rendered futile in getting the entire
          building suit (sic). In that event, clause (rr) would become an
          illusory provision. The object of providing speedier relief of
          eviction of the tenant to such landlords would become nugatory and the
          object of clause (rr) would stand defeated. Such an intention cannot
          be imputed to a same legislature.

          <b>19. </b>In our view, the question whether the eviction of the
          tenant has to be ordered from any specified part of the building under
          tenancy is not within the jurisdiction of the Prescribed Authority,
          while acting under clause (rr), irrespective of the occurrence of
          subsequent events which may make it improper to order the eviction
          from the entire building, or which may tend to establish that the need
          set up by the landlord can be satisfied by ordering eviction of the
          tenant from a specified part of the building under tenancy.

          <b>20. </b>In Tara Chand Khandelwal v. Prescribed Authority, Agra,
          (1976 All LJ 708), it was held that subsequent events or facts cannot
          be considered and the Prescribed Authority is bound to order eviction
          according to the permission. This case lays down the law correctly.

          <b>22. </b>When an application is made under Section 21, the
          Prescribed Authority has to satisfy itself that the grounds mentioned
          in Section 21(1) and (2) exist. It then considers whether the
          established grounds can be satisfied by ordering eviction either from
          the whole or part of the accommodation. But, under cl.(rr), the second
          part of the enquiry is forbidden.

      <div class="jpara">
        <p>
          "Consideration of relative hardship to the landlord and the tenant,
          may also persuade the Prescribed Authority not to order eviction of
          the tenant from the entire house, but to order his eviction from a
          portion of the house. When such is the legal position when the
          landlord makes an application for the first time under Section 21 of
          the Act, we do not see why the legal position should be different
          under clause (rr) of Section 43(2) of the present Act. The words
          'shall order the eviction of the tenant from the building under
          tenancy' should, in our opinion, be read as 'shall order eviction of
          the tenant from the entire building or any portion thereof."

          In the aforesaid case, the Division Bench equated the jurisdiction of
          the Prescribed Authority while deciding an application under Section
          21 of the present Act with the jurisdiction it has been conferred for
          giving effect to the permission granted under Section 3 of the old
          Act. As explained above, the two situations are different. Clause (rr)
          specifically prohibits the Prescribed Authority from satisfying itself
          afresh that the grounds exist. It has only to see that the grounds on
          which permission was granted under the old Act are such as answer the
          description of the grounds mentioned in Sub-Section (1) or (2) of
          Section 21.It has no power to satisfy itself as to any other matter.
          While disposing of an application under Section 21(1), it has an
          additional jurisdiction to decide whether the grounds established by
          the landlord require eviction from the whole or a part of the
          building. This latter jurisdiction has not been given to the
          Prescribed Authority while dealing with an application under clause
          (rr) for eviction of the tenant on the basis of the permission granted
          under the old Act. That is why the two situations cannot be equated.
          The Division Bench, if we may say so with respect fell into an error
          in overlooking this distinction. We are unable to approve the decision
          in Smt. Sarju Devi.

          The Prescribed Authority when approached under S.21 read with S.43(rr)
